## Hi there üëã


Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Tushar Mohite

Software Test Engineer
----------------------

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as a research chemist. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems. I got my Master's Degree from the University of Eastern Finland and have been a PhD fellow at the University of Jyv√§skyl√§ for 3 years. My research field was computational physical chemistry, which involved modelling of chemical reactions through massively-parallel computing. Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes. I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal ‚Äî to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years. CV

* üåç  I'm based in Hyderabad
* üñ•Ô∏è  See my portfolio at [Visit me](http://https://github.com/QATush)
* ‚úâÔ∏è  You can contact me at [tushartesterqa4545@gmail.com](mailto:tushartesterqa4545@gmail.com)
* üß†  I'm learning 1.Cypress: Type: End-to-End Testing Framework Language: JavaScript Key Features: Fast: Cypress is known for its speed and efficient testing capabilities. Real-time: Provides real-time reloading as you make changes to your test scripts. Automatic Waiting: Automatically waits for elements to appear before interacting with them. UI for Debugging: Comes with a built-in UI for easier debugging of test scripts. Cross-browser Testing: Supports cross-browser testing. Tips for Learning Cypress: Start with the official Cypress documentation. Practice writing test scripts for various scenarios. Explore Cypress commands and assertions. Understand how to handle asynchronous behavior in Cypress. 2.Tosca: Type: Test Automation and Continuous Testing Platform Key Features: Model-Based Testing: Tosca uses a model-based approach for test automation, allowing testers to create tests graphically. Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Testing: Supports testing on different browsers and platforms. Integration with DevOps: Tosca integrates with various DevOps tools for continuous testing. Test Data Management: Offers capabilities for managing test data effectively. Reusability: Promotes the reuse of test assets. Tips for Learning Tosca: Familiarize yourself with the Tosca Commander, where you create and manage test cases. Explore the model-based testing approach in Tosca. Learn how to integrate Tosca with other tools in the testing and development pipeline. Understand how to create reusable modules and test data. Both Cypress and Tosca have their strengths, and the choice between them may depend on the specific requirements of your project. If your goal is to perform end-to-end testing with a focus on JavaScript-based web applications, Cypress is an excellent choice. On the other hand, if you're looking for a comprehensive test automation platform with model-based testing capabilities, Tosca might be more suitable.
* ü§ù  I'm open to collaborating on 1.Online Platforms: Explore online platforms that facilitate collaboration on testing projects. Websites like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket host a variety of open-source projects where you can contribute to manual testing efforts. 2.Testing Communities: Join testing communities or forums where professionals discuss projects and share collaboration opportunities. Websites like LinkedIn, Reddit, or specialized testing forums often have threads or groups dedicated to collaboration. Connect with Testers: Reach out to fellow testers on professional networking platforms. Connect with them, express your interest in collaboration, and discuss potential projects. 3.Participate in Meetups/Conferences: Attend testing meetups, webinars, or conferences where you can network with professionals. Use these events as an opportunity to express your interest in collaboration and exchange contact information.4.Local Testing Groups: If possible, join or create local testing groups in your area. Face-to-face interactions can sometimes lead to fruitful collaboration opportunities.
* ‚ö°  "Software testers are like detectives of the digital world. They meticulously investigate, interrogate, and sometimes interrogate again, all to uncover the elusive bugs and glitches hidden in the code. Their superpower? The keen eye for detail and a relentless pursuit of perfection in an imperfect digital universe!"

  ### Some Fun Facts about me:
 I love playing video games and you'll find me playing games on my [Twitch Channel](http://twitch.tv/MishManners) and live coding! I'm super into sports, including lots of outdoor adventures like hiking, snowboarding, and wakeboarding. You might run into me at an event, so make sure you follow my socials for all the updates. For a super quick live response, jump into my Twitch chat during a live stream. Or DM me on Instagram or Twitter.
